Description: By effective integration of somatic mutation data and molecular interaction data, DriverRWH prioritizes altered genes.A weighted Hypergraph model is formed by combining the degree of the PPI sub-network composed of each patient's mutated genes.Mutated genes are ranked by the random walk on the weighted Hypergraph model.
