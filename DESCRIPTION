Description: DriverRWH prioritizes altered genes by effective integration of somatic mutation data and molecular interaction data. A weighted Hypergraph model is formed by combining the degree of the PPI sub-network composed of each patient's mu-tated genes. Mutated genes are ranked by the random walk on the weighted Hypergraph model.
